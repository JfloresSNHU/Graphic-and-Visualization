How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software now with a more experienced point of view by knowing the tools and codes that cna be used to manipulate simple designs
and make them complex.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The work on the project helped me craft the skills of using light and texture in creating the perfect scene, 
applying them to objects making sure it can come to life.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started by defining the project's goals, all requirements, and technical constraints. Then I would write psuedocode to make sure i was 
writing out my functions and writing code correctly. After that to design the scenes i would create some versions of scenes that allowed me to iterate on the design, 
ensuring it met project requirements.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
These steps reinforce a user-centered, iterative design approach. Using early designs and benchmarking will be valuable for complex projects where user needs may shift or be difficult to define early on.

How do I approach developing programs?
Clearly understanding what the program must achieve, including edge cases and user experience needs.
Breaking the problem into smaller, manageable modules helped in building flexible, maintainable code.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Building the 3D scene in layers, starting with the foundational elements, and progressively adding details.
Implementing shading and texturing for realistic visuals was optimized through experimentation with shaders and frame rates to achieve high-quality rendering.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration allowed me to refine visual elements, add new features, and optimize performance based on my testing feedback.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Early stages of my coding focused on functionality, while later milestones refined code structure, performance, and readability.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Developing a computational approach to problem solving helps in critical thinking, improving decision-making in varied contexts.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Visualizations make complex data and concepts more understandable, valuable for subjects like math, science, and engineering.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Understanding 3D graphics enables the development of intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces, key in industries such as game development, simulation, and product design.
